# Forensic Audit & Predictive Pricing Strategy for Health Insurance Funds

This project focuses on conducting forensic audits to detect misappropriation within health insurance funds and developing a predictive pricing strategy. The goal was to ensure compliance while also improving customer conversion rates by 20% and enhancing revenue forecasting accuracy for new policies.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for:
- **Forensic audits**: Detecting misappropriation in health insurance funds using statistical analysis.
- **Predictive pricing**: Developing a pricing strategy that boosted customer conversion rates by 20% and improved the revenue forecasting accuracy for new policies.

The project involves data analysis with **Python**, leveraging **Numpy**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn** for visualization and analysis.

## Key Features

1. **Forensic Auditing**:
   - Detects anomalies and potential misappropriation in financial data.
   - Ensures compliance with financial regulations and standards.
